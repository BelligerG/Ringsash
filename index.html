            <h1>Ringsash Methodist Church</h1>

            <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>

            <p>To share the gospel by word and deed&#59; to build bridges and to be involved in the community.</p>

            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>The Ringsash Circuit is set in the heart of beautiful Mid Devon countryside, situated 
                between Dartmoor and Exmoor National Parks and the dramatic North and picturesque South 
                Devon coastlines. This area of Devon is known for its rolling hills, hidden woodlands, rivers 
                and verdant valleys, teeming with wildlife.  Local restaurants, cafes and farm shops make 
                the most of the high quality local produce on offer. The quality of the natural environment 
                is matched by the richness of its cultural heritage with the historic cathedral City of 
                Exeter 30 minutes away linking the area to rest of the country with the M5, 
                mainline station and international airport. We have four
                churches in our Circuit and we would very much welcome you to come along to any of the
                activities that take place. The churches are located in various sized villages, Copplestone,
                Black Dog (Hele Lane), Morchard Bishop and Witheridge. In recent years there has been
                considerable refurbishment, modernisation and extension to all four churches which are
                now in good condition. The circuit has one Superintendent Minister who has oversight and
                pastoral care for all chapels.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>

            <h3 class="indent"><em>by Roger Thorne</em></h3>

            <h4>Who Were The Bible Christians?</h4>

            <p>The chapels in the Ringsash Circuit were built by a small Methodist denomination &#8208; the
                Bible Christians. They began in North West Devon and North Cornwall in 1815 and their
                strength was always in the South West. Most of their early chapels were in rural areas and up
                to the 1830&#39;s a large number of preaching places were opened in North Devon. Most were not
                purpose&#8208;built chapels but farm houses, cottages and even mills. Although a tiny, poor
                denomination, the Bible Christians modelled their organisation on the mighty Wesleyan
                Church and in 1819 they divided their scattered places into circuits (groups of chapels that
                were cared for by one or more ministers). Ringsash was one of these earliest circuits. This
                name needs explaining&#33; One of the places in their circuit was &#34;Ashreigney&#34; but they turned its
                name round to become &#34;Ringsash&#34;. (They did the same in West Somerset and their chapel in
                &#34;Brompton Regis&#34;, was called &#34;Kingsbrompton&#34;.)</p>

            <p>Within a few years new places were opened and by 1824 the Ringsash circuit had 15
                places and in another ten years this grew to 31, including Bishops Tawton, South Molton,
                Rackenford, Hittisleigh. In 1838 it was divided into Upper and Lower Parts and as other
                circuits were formed and established themselves, chapels were taken away from Ringsash.
                BUT since 1819 there has been a Ringsash Circuit and it has never included anything but
                chapels in the Bible Christian tradition. The most recent change was in 2010 when several
                chapels joined the South Molton Circuit, leaving Ringsash with just five chapels. Ironically
                Ashreigney was not one of the five.</p>

            <p>In 1907 the Bible Christians joined two other small Methodist denominations to form
                the &#34;United Methodist Church&#34;. Then in 1932 the United Methodists joined the Wesleyans
                and Primitive Methodists to form the modern &#34;Methodist Church of Great Britain&#34;. In 1907
                Ringsash contained 13 chapels and each had a Biblical name &#8208; a long&#8208;standing Bible Christian
                tradition. Witheridge chapel came to Ringsash from the former Tiverton Circuit in the early
                1970â€™s but without a Biblical name&#33;</p>

            <h4>Our Churches</h4>

            <h4 class="indent">&#34;Ebenezer&#34; Chapel, Copplestone, (OS SS 770 026)</h5>

            <p>This flourishing chapel was at the edge of three parishes until Copplestone became a
                civil parish in 1992. The present building was in Down St. Mary, its cemetery in Colebrooke
                and the former chapel of 1831 across the road was in Crediton&#33; The chapel&#39;s old name,
                &#34;Ebenezer&#34; comes from the Old Testament, Samuel 7.12.</p>

            <p>There was Methodist preaching here from 1819 in a cottage and this later moved to
                Elston Farm until a first chapel was built about 1831, the same year that the road to Barnstaple
                became a turnpike. Eventually more room was needed and in 1888 the present chapel was
                built across the road and the old one then was used for the Sunday School. The present
                community room behind church was built in 1981 and the old chapel sold.</p>

            <h4 class="indent">&#34;Providence&#34; or &#34;Hele Lane&#34; Chapel</h5>

            <h5>The Old Chapel at Hele Lane in Thelbridge Parish (OS SS 794 108)</h5>

            <p>In 1858 a body of Bible Christians bought a privately owned chapel, schoolroom,
                cottage and burying ground at Hele Lane for &#163;2, which then was vested in trustees. Although
                cheap, this building caused expense later as one of the walls collapsed and had to be rebuilt in
                the 1920&#39;s.</p>

            <h5>The New Chapel at Black Dog in Washford Pyne Parish (OS SS 806 098)</h5>

            <p>In the 1950&#39;s the congregation was not large but the building was old. When the
                council school at Black Dog was closed and offered for sale in 1955, the congregation
                agonised about buying it. They decided against and the school was duly sold. BUT it came
                back on the market quickly and this was regarded as prophetic so it was bought and opened as
                a chapel in 1956 and is in use today. The new chapel, between Tiverton and Morchard Bishop
                is about a mile from Hele Lane but has kept the familiar name.</p>

            <p>After the move the old chapel was demolished to enlarge the burying ground which is
                still in use.</p>

            <h4 class="indent">&#34;Emmanuel&#34; Chapel, Fore Street, MORCHARD BISHOP (OS SS 768 077)</h5>

            <p>Morchard is a large village on the old turnpike road but its prosperity suffered when
                the new turnpike was built in the valley in the 1820&#39;s&#33; In Fore Street is a row of thatched
                cottages, said to be the longest in Britain.</p>

            <p>Bible Christian preachers first came to the village in 1819 and a small congregation
                was gathered. This grew so that in 1846 a chapel was built, which is still in use today. A local
                man, James Way, became a Bible Christian minister in 1826 and in 1850 he sailed to
                Australia, where many Bible Christians from the South West had already emigrated. His son
                Samuel, who was educated at Shebbear College in Devon, became a lawyer and eventually
                rose to be Sir Samuel Way, Chief Justice of South Australia. The Bible Christians copied the
                annual Conference of the Wesleyans, but on a much smaller scale and in 1854 it was held in
                the Morchard chapel, causing some local excitement. The adjacent Sunday school was built in
                1928.</p>

            <h4 class="indent">Chapel, WITHERIDGE (OS SS 804 145)</h5>

            <p>Witheridge is a large ancient village between Tiverton and South Molton. Bible
                Christian services were being held here in 1819 in a succession of houses until the first
                permanent chapel was acquired, by converting a cob and thatch barn in 1855. This was on the
                site of the present school room. A Sunday school was started and a new chapel was soon
                needed. So two cottages beside the chapel were bought and the present chapel was built,
                opening in 1859. The preacher at the opening was F. W. Bourne, the author of &#34;Billy Bray, the
                King&#39;s Son&#34; â€“ the Bible Christian best&#8208;seller. Then in 1903 the present school room was built.</p>
